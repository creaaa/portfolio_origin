## Function

As I keep on making iOS app, I noticed that I've always been writing same code or some pattern that appears so often. I thought that now was the time to make my own framework. I put a lot of useful extension so that I could write a code in a type-safe way and more efficiently. The most remarkable characteristics is that all methods in this library are invoked through a special property "crea", that is, I follow the notation as RxSwift and KingFisher does. Through this project, I've been learning how to make an iOS framework and maintain the project.
